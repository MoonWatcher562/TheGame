Can we start working on the story? I think I want to have it split into like Acts or Episodes from a narrative perspective (it also gives me room to expand later on if I want to add more story), so can we start on basic synopsis for probably like 4 or 5 Acts?

Hello, I would like to continue working on the story if you're up for it. I want to work on the rest of Act 1, and start planning out some of the physical areas that will be present
