## Core Mechanic: Bonding

## Core Mechanic: Bonding

The bonding system, **Resonance**, describes a permanent, supernatural bond that can only be formed between fated individuals known as "compatibles." The bond ties together their minds, souls, and wills, causing them to share thoughts, emotions, and even their life force—if one dies, the other perishes as well.

**1. Fated Potential:** Resonance cannot be forced. Only compatibles have the potential to form a bond, often feeling a strange sense of familiarity or a subconscious connection upon meeting.

**2. Cultivated Strength:** The bond only forms after compatibles build a foundation of trust and understanding. After forming, the bond's strength is measured by a **Resonance Level**. This level is cultivated by the player through:
*   **Supportive Dialogue Choices:** Aligning with and supporting the partner character.
*   **Combat Synergy:** Executing combos and fighting effectively as a single unit.
*   **Shared Story Moments:** Overcoming challenges together in personal and main story quests.

A high Resonance Level unlocks new abilities ("Resonance Arts") and strengthens the characters, giving them the power to challenge their destiny. A low or neglected Resonance Level can lead to gameplay penalties and negative narrative outcomes, tying the core mechanic directly to the central theme of "breaking fate." 

## Core Combat

Combat is a real-time system built on two key customizable elements: **Aspects** and **Arts**. Each character in the party has their own unique build.

**1. Aspects:**
An Aspect is a character's chosen combat style or weapon, which dictates their basic playstyle. Each character has a selection of unique Aspects they can equip (one at a time). Equipping an Aspect determines the pool of "Aspect Arts" the character can use.

**2. Arts:**
Each character equips a total of six Arts, which are their special moves used in combat. These are split into two categories:

*   **Aspect Arts (3 slots):** These abilities are tied directly to the currently equipped Aspect. For example, if Miyako equips the "Shadow Fan" Aspect, her Aspect Arts would be graceful, sweeping shadow attacks. If she switched to a "Puppet Master" Aspect, they would change to moves that directly command her puppets.
*   **Soul Arts (3 slots):** These abilities are innate to the character and never change, regardless of their Aspect. They represent the character's core identity and power.

### Example Aspects

#### Miyako (The Shadow Puppeteer)

1.  **Aspect: Marionettist**
    *   **Weapon:** Shadow Grimoire
    *   **Focus:** Puppet Mastery & Area Control. This is Miyako's default style, focusing on summoning and commanding multiple, diverse shadow puppets to overwhelm the battlefield.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Summon Sentinel*, *Puppet Swarm*, *Commander's Mark*.

2.  **Aspect: Umbral Assassin**
    *   **Weapon:** Twin Shadowdaggers
    *   **Focus:** Stealth & Single-Target Damage. This style is about merging with the shadows to debuff enemies and execute powerful surprise attacks.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Shadow Strike*, *Veil of Night*, *Enfeebling Hex*.

3.  **Aspect: Weaver of Night**
    *   **Weapon:** War Fan
    *   **Focus:** Support & Crowd Control. This is a strategic, defensive style focused on weaving shadows into tangible traps and zones to control the flow of combat.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Shadow Mire*, *Umbral Ward*, *Grasping Tendrils*.

#### Kaito (The Adamant Bulwark)

1.  **Aspect: Juggernaut**
    *   **Weapon:** Kinetic Gauntlets
    *   **Focus:** Retaliation & Offensive Tanking. This Aspect turns Kaito into a walking fortress who converts absorbed damage into offensive power.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Kinetic Rebound*, *Vengeful Strike*, *Unstoppable Force*.

2.  **Aspect: Guardian**
    *   **Weapon:** Tower Shield
    *   **Focus:** Pure Defense & Ally Protection. This is the ultimate protector build, focused on creating massive shields and redirecting damage from allies to himself.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Sanctuary*, *Intercede*, *Provoke*.

3.  **Aspect: Epicenter**
    *   **Weapon:** War Hammer
    *   **Focus:** Battlefield Control & Disruption. This style is about using kinetic power to manipulate the battlefield itself, grouping and disabling enemies for Miyako.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Gravity Well*, *Concussive Wave*, *Kinetic Stasis*. 

## Main Characters

(Descriptions of the two main characters)
The first main character is **Miyako**. Her main ability is **Shadow Puppeteer**.

*   **Concept:** The Shadow Puppeteer. Miyako uses shadows as a medium to create independent creatures and constructs to complete tasks, engage enemies, or solve puzzles. Her fighting style focuses on indirect combat, area control, and strategic manipulation.
*   **Personality:** Shy and Reserved. Miyako is naturally timid and prefers to hide her face behind a kitsune mask. Despite her shyness, she possesses a deep well of empathy and a strong, if quiet, will to protect others, especially Kaito once their bond forms.
*   **Physical Appearance:** Long, black, braided hair, always adorned with a kitsune mask. She has subtle cat ears and a tail, suggesting a unique heritage. She wears an elegant black and gold kimono/robe that allows for agile movement, and subtly blends into shadows. 

The second main character is **Kaito**. His main ability is **Kinetic Force**.

*   **Concept:** The Adamant Bulwark. Kaito manifests his will as pure kinetic energy, allowing him to create barriers, absorb impacts, and unleash concussive blasts. His fighting style is entirely defensive and protective, focused on controlling the battlefield and shielding his allies.
*   **Personality:** The Worried Protector. Kaito is fiercely loyal and defensive, especially of Miyako after they form their bond. He is deeply mistrustful of others and his pushy, often confrontational attitude stems from a desperate need to keep his loved ones safe in a world designed to kill them.
*   **Physical Appearance:** Sturdy and well-built, with practical, reinforced clothing. He often has a tense, guarded posture. His kinetic energy might manifest visually as shimmering, clear distortions in the air around his hands and body when in combat. 

## World & Lore

The game takes place in the **Soulscape**, a digital reality where the souls of sentient beings are stored and manifested as physical inhabitants. This world is governed by a strict, artificial cycle of reincarnation.

*   **The Cycle:** The inhabitants are forced to fight and die in a meaningless, never-ending war. Upon death, their souls are wiped of memories and reincarnated into new bodies to repeat the process. This system is controlled and monitored by powerful beings, the "Gods," and was designed by a master architect known as the **Orchestrator**.
*   **Resonators - The Anomaly:** The act of Resonance is a glitch in the system. When two "compatibles" form a bond, their souls are permanently altered. They break free from the Cycle, retaining their memories and gaining true free will. They can no longer be reincarnated, making their lives finite but truly their own. This makes them the only real threat to the Orchestrator's control.

## Story Synopsis

### Act 1: The Echo of Fate
*   **Synopsis:** Miyako, a timid shadow puppeteer, lives a quiet life within a seemingly endless war, haunted by a vague sense of déjà vu. Kaito, a fiercely protective but isolated warrior, navigates the same brutal reality, driven by an instinct to shield the innocent. Their paths cross in a moment of shared peril, forcing an accidental Resonance. This triggers their awakening: they gain memories of past lives and realize the Soulscape is a digital prison where souls are endlessly reincarnated. Confused and targeted by unseen forces, they must learn to trust each other and master their newfound bond to survive.

#### Act 1: Physical Locations
*   **Echoing Metropolis (Starting Zone):** A ruined, war-torn urban environment where Miyako initially resides. It's characterized by crumbling buildings, makeshift defenses, and a constant threat of "Cycle Enforcers." This is where Miyako and Kaito first meet and form their Resonance.
*   **Verdant Scar:** A desolate, overgrown area outside the city, where nature has reclaimed remnants of an ancient battlefield. This could be where Miyako and Kaito practice their newfound Resonance Arts and learn to fight together, away from immediate threats, finding solace and strength amidst the resilient flora.
*   **The Nexus Sanctuary (Hidden Base):** A secluded, natural cavern or a hidden section within the Wasteland City that becomes Miyako and Kaito's temporary base of operations. It's a place of relative safety where they can recuperate, discuss their situation, and discover more about the Soulscape through ancient data fragments or cryptic carvings.

#### Act 1: Detailed Plot Points
(To be elaborated upon later)

### Act 2: Unraveling the Cycle
*   **Synopsis:** Now fully Resonated and outside the reincarnation cycle, Miyako and Kaito become fugitives. They begin to explore the Soulscape, meeting other "normal" inhabitants trapped in the cycle and witnessing the suffering it causes. They encounter remnants of older, forgotten data—glitches in the system that hint at the true nature of the Orchestrator and the "Gods" who enforce the cycle. They seek out fragmented legends and forgotten lore, slowly piecing together the true history of their world and the mechanism of their "fate." Their Resonance Level deepens as they rely on each other.

### Act 3: The Orchestrator's Hand
*   **Synopsis:** As Miyako and Kaito's understanding grows, so does the Orchestrator's awareness of them. The "Gods" intensify their hunt, sending increasingly powerful constructs and agents. The duo must make difficult choices, sometimes sacrificing others or facing moral ambiguities as they try to save those still trapped. They learn that the Cycle isn't just about control, but perhaps a twisted form of "preservation." This act culminates in their first direct, albeit indirect, confrontation with a high-ranking enforcer of the Orchestrator, pushing their Resonance to its limits.

### Act 4: Forging a New Path
*   **Synopsis:** Having survived the direct assault, Miyako and Kaito realize they cannot defeat the Orchestrator through strength alone. They must find a way to dismantle its control over the Soulscape. This involves seeking out ancient "nexus points," forgotten code, or even recruiting other nascent Resonators (perhaps through the gacha system, tied to character stories) who also show potential for awakening. They face ethical dilemmas about the true cost of "breaking fate" and what a free Soulscape would look like. Their bond is tested, forcing them to confront their deepest fears and insecurities.

### Act 5: Symphony of Freedom
*   **Synopsis:** With their Resonance at its peak and armed with critical knowledge and potential allies, Miyako and Kaito launch their final assault on the Orchestrator's core. This could be a physical location, a conceptual space, or even directly within the Orchestrator's consciousness. The confrontation is epic, forcing them to utilize every aspect of their combined powers and the strength of their bond. The "breaking fate" theme is fully realized as they make a choice that fundamentally alters the Soulscape. The ending could involve freeing all souls, creating a new, truly free world, or even absorbing the Orchestrator's power for themselves, leaving a lasting impact on their world.
