### Act 1: The Calling of Fate
*   **Synopsis:** Miyako, a timid shadow puppeteer, lives a quiet life within a seemingly endless war, haunted by a vague sense of déjà vu. Kaito, a fiercely protective but isolated warrior, navigates the same brutal reality, driven by an instinct to shield the innocent. Their paths cross in a moment of shared peril, forcing an accidental Resonance. This triggers their awakening: they gain memories of past lives and realize the Soulscape is a digital prison where souls are endlessly reincarnated. Confused and targeted by unseen forces, they must learn to trust each other and master their newfound bond to survive.

#### Act 1: Physical Locations
*   **Echoing Metropolis (Starting Zone):** A ruined, war-torn urban environment where Miyako initially resides. It's characterized by crumbling buildings, makeshift defenses, and a constant threat of "Cycle Enforcers." This is where Miyako and Kaito first meet and form their Resonance.
*   **Verdant Scar:** A desolate, overgrown area outside the city, where nature has reclaimed remnants of an ancient battlefield. This could be where Miyako and Kaito practice their newfound Resonance Arts and learn to fight together, away from immediate threats, finding solace and strength amidst the resilient flora.
*   **The Nexus Sanctuary (Hidden Base):** A secluded, natural cavern or a hidden section within the Wasteland City that becomes Miyako and Kaito's temporary base of operations. It's a place of relative safety where they can recuperate, discuss their situation, and discover more about the Soulscape through ancient data fragments or cryptic carvings.
