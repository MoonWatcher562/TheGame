## Core Mechanic: Bonding

The bonding system, **Resonance**, describes a permanent, supernatural bond that can only be formed between fated individuals known as "compatibles." The bond ties together their minds, souls, and wills, causing them to share thoughts, emotions, and even their life force -- if one dies, the other perishes as well.

**1. Fated Potential:** Resonance cannot be forced. Only compatibles have the potential to form a bond, often feeling a strange sense of familiarity or a subconscious connection upon meeting.

**2. Cultivated Strength:** The bond forms after two compatibles go through a traumatic or life altering event. After forming, the bond's strength is measured by a **Resonance Level**. This level is cultivated by the player through:
*   **Supportive Dialogue Choices:** Aligning with and supporting the partner character.
*   **Combat Synergy:** Executing combos and fighting effectively as a single unit.
*   **Shared Story Moments:** Overcoming challenges together in personal and main story quests.

A high Resonance Level unlocks new abilities ("Resonance Arts") and strengthens the characters, giving them the power to challenge their destiny. A low or neglected Resonance Level can lead to gameplay penalties and negative narrative outcomes, tying the core mechanic directly to the central theme of "breaking fate." 

## Core Combat

Combat is a real-time system built on two key customizable elements: **Aspects** and **Arts**. Each character in the party has their own unique build.

**1. Aspects:**
An Aspect is a character's chosen combat style or weapon, which dictates their basic playstyle. Each character has a selection of unique Aspects they can equip (one at a time). Equipping an Aspect determines the pool of "Aspect Arts" the character can use.

**2. Arts:**
Each character equips a total of six Arts, which are their special moves used in combat. These are split into two categories:

*   **Aspect Arts (3 slots):** These abilities are tied directly to the currently equipped Aspect. For example, if Miyako equips the "Shadow Fan" Aspect, her Aspect Arts would be graceful, sweeping shadow attacks. If she switched to a "Puppet Master" Aspect, they would change to moves that directly command her puppets.
*   **Soul Arts (3 slots):** These abilities are innate to the character and never change, regardless of their Aspect. They represent the character's core identity and power. 

### Example Aspects

#### Miyako (The Shadow Puppeteer)

1.  **Aspect: Marionettist**
    *   **Weapon:** Shadow Grimoire
    *   **Focus:** Puppet Mastery & Area Control. This is Miyako's default style, focusing on summoning and commanding multiple, diverse shadow puppets to overwhelm the battlefield.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Summon Sentinel*, *Puppet Swarm*, *Commander's Mark*.

2.  **Aspect: Umbral Assassin**
    *   **Weapon:** Twin Shadowdaggers
    *   **Focus:** Stealth & Single-Target Damage. This style is about merging with the shadows to debuff enemies and execute powerful surprise attacks.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Shadow Strike*, *Veil of Night*, *Enfeebling Hex*.

3.  **Aspect: Weaver of Night**
    *   **Weapon:** War Fan
    *   **Focus:** Support & Crowd Control. This is a strategic, defensive style focused on weaving shadows into tangible traps and zones to control the flow of combat.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Shadow Mire*, *Umbral Ward*, *Grasping Tendrils*.

#### Kaito (The Adamant Bulwark)

1.  **Aspect: Juggernaut**
    *   **Weapon:** Kinetic Gauntlets
    *   **Focus:** Retaliation & Offensive Tanking. This Aspect turns Kaito into a walking fortress who converts absorbed damage into offensive power.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Kinetic Rebound*, *Vengeful Strike*, *Unstoppable Force*.

2.  **Aspect: Guardian**
    *   **Weapon:** Tower Shield
    *   **Focus:** Pure Defense & Ally Protection. This is the ultimate protector build, focused on creating massive shields and redirecting damage from allies to himself.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Sanctuary*, *Intercede*, *Provoke*.

3.  **Aspect: Epicenter**
    *   **Weapon:** War Hammer
    *   **Focus:** Battlefield Control & Disruption. This style is about using kinetic power to manipulate the battlefield itself, grouping and disabling enemies for Miyako.
    *   **Example Arts:** *Gravity Well*, *Concussive Wave*, *Kinetic Stasis*.
