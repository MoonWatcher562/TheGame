## Main Characters

(Descriptions of the two main characters)
The first main character is **Miyako**. Her main ability is **Shadow Puppeteer**.

*   **Concept:** The Shadow Puppeteer. Miyako uses shadows as a medium to create independent creatures and constructs to complete tasks, engage enemies, or solve puzzles. Her fighting style focuses on indirect combat, area control, and strategic manipulation.
*   **Personality:** Shy and Reserved. Miyako is naturally timid and prefers to hide her face behind a kitsune mask. Despite her shyness, she possesses a deep well of empathy and a strong, if quiet, will to protect others, especially Kaito once their bond forms.
*   **Physical Appearance:** Long, black, braided hair, always adorned with a kitsune mask. She has subtle cat ears and a tail, suggesting a unique heritage. She wears an elegant black and gold kimono/robe that allows for agile movement, and subtly blends into shadows. 

The second main character is **Kaito**. His main ability is **Kinetic Force**.

*   **Concept:** The Adamant Bulwark. Kaito manifests his will as pure kinetic energy, allowing him to create barriers, absorb impacts, and unleash concussive blasts. His fighting style is entirely defensive and protective, focused on controlling the battlefield and shielding his allies.
*   **Personality:** The Worried Protector. Kaito is fiercely loyal and defensive, especially of Miyako after they form their bond. He is deeply mistrustful of others and his pushy, often confrontational attitude stems from a desperate need to keep his loved ones safe in a world designed to kill them.
*   **Physical Appearance:** Sturdy and well-built, with practical, reinforced clothing. He often has a tense, guarded posture. His kinetic energy might manifest visually as shimmering, clear distortions in the air around his hands and body when in combat. 

## World & Lore

The game takes place in the **Soulscape**, a digital reality where the souls of sentient beings are stored and manifested as physical inhabitants. This world is governed by a strict, artificial cycle of reincarnation.

*   **The Cycle:** The inhabitants are forced to fight and die in a meaningless, never-ending war. Upon death, their souls are wiped of memories and reincarnated into new bodies to repeat the process. This system is controlled and monitored by powerful beings, the "Gods," and was designed by a master architect known as the **Orchestrator**.
